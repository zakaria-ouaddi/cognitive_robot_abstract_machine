Cognitive Robot Abstract Machine (CRAM)
=======================================

Monorepo for the CRAM cognitive architecture.

A hybrid cognitive architecture enabling robots to accomplish everyday
manipulation tasks.

This documentation serves as a central hub for all sub-packages within
the CRAM ecosystem.

About CRAM
----------

The Cognitive Robot Abstract Machine (CRAM) ecosystem is a comprehensive
cognitive architecture for autonomous robots, organized as a monorepo of
interconnected components. Together, they form a pipeline from abstract
task descriptions to physically executable actions, bridging the gap
between high-level intentions and low-level robot control.

Architecture Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CRAM consists of the following sub-packages:

-  `CoraPlex <https://cram2.github.io/cognitive_robot_abstract_machine/coraplex>`__:
   is the central control unit of the CRAM architecture. It
   interprets and executes high-level action plans using the
   CRAM plan language (CPL).

-  The `Semantic Digital Twin <https://cram2.github.io/cognitive_robot_abstract_machine/semantic_digital_twin>`__
   is a world representation that integrates sensor data,
   robot models, and external knowledge in form of semantic
   annotations to provide a comprehensive understanding of
   the robot's environment and tasks.

-  `Giskardpy <https://cram2.github.io/cognitive_robot_abstract_machine/giskardpy>`__
   is a Python library for motion control for robots. It uses constraint-
   and optimization-based task-space control to control the whole
   body of a robot.

-  `KRROOD <https://cram2.github.io/cognitive_robot_abstract_machine/krrood>`__
   is a Python framework that integrates symbolic knowledge
   representation, powerful querying, and rule-based reasoning through
   intuitive, object-oriented abstractions.

-  `Probabilistic
   Model <https://cram2.github.io/cognitive_robot_abstract_machine/probabilistic_model>`__
   is a Python library that offers a clean and
   unified API for probabilistic models, similar to scikit-learn for
   classical machine learning.

-  `Random
   Events <https://cram2.github.io/cognitive_robot_abstract_machine/random_events>`__
   is a Python library to provide a simple and flexible way to generate events that are suitable for probabilistic reasoning.

Installation
------------

To install the CRAM architecture, follow these steps:

Set up the Python virtual environment:

.. code:: bash

  sudo apt install -y virtualenv virtualenvwrapper && \
  grep -qxF 'export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs' ~/.bashrc || echo 'export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs' >> ~/.bashrc && \
  grep -qxF 'export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3' ~/.bashrc || echo 'export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3' >> ~/.bashrc && \
  grep -qxF 'source /usr/share/virtualenvwrapper/virtualenvwrapper.sh' ~/.bashrc || echo 'source /usr/share/virtualenvwrapper/virtualenvwrapper.sh' >> ~/.bashrc && \
  source ~/.bashrc && \
  mkvirtualenv cram-env

Activate / deactivate

..code:: bash

  workon cram-env

  deactivate

Install using UV
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the whole repo we use uv (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv),
first to install uv:

.. code:: bash

  # On macOS and Linux.
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

then install packages:

.. code:: bash

  uv sync --active

Alternative: Poetry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternatively you can use poetry to install all packages in the
repository.

Install poetry if you haven't already:

.. code:: bash

  pip install poetry

Install the CRAM package along with its dependencies:

.. code:: bash

  poetry install

About the AICOR Institute for Artificial Intelligence
-----------------------------------------------------

The AICOR Institute for Artificial Intelligence researches how robots
can understand and perform everyday tasks using fundamental cognitive
abilities – essentially teaching robots to think and act in practical,
real-world situations.

The institute is headed by Prof. Michael Beetz, and is based at the
`University of Bremen <https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/>`__, where is is
affiliated with the `Center for Computing and Communication Technologies
(TZI) <https://www.uni-bremen.de/tzi/>`__ and the high-profile area
`Minds, Media and Machines
(MMM) <https://minds-media-machines.de/en/>`__.

Beyond Bremen, AICOR is also part of several research networks:

-  `Robotics Institute Germany
   (RIG) <https://robotics-institute-germany.de/>`__ – a national
   robotics research initiative
-  `euROBIN <https://www.eurobin-project.eu/>`__ – a European network
   focused on advancing robot learning and intelligence
