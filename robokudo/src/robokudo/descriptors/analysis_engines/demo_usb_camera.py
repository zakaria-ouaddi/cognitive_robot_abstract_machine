"""Analysis engine for demonstrating USB camera integration.

This module provides an analysis engine that demonstrates how to read and process
video data from various sources using OpenCV, including:
- USB webcams
- Video files
- Image files
- Network video streams

The pipeline implements basic video capture and visualization functionality,
serving as a starting point for more complex video processing applications.

.. note::
    The default configuration uses a USB webcam (device 0), but can be easily
    modified to use other video sources by changing the device parameter.
