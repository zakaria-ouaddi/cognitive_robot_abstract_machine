# Hands on Object Relational Mapping in CoraPlex

(orm_example)=

This tutorial will walk you through the serialization of a minimal plan in coraplex.
First we will import sqlalchemy, create an in-memory database and connect a session to it.

```python
import sqlalchemy.orm
from krrood.ormatic.utils import create_engine

engine = create_engine("sqlite+pysqlite:///:memory:", echo=False)
session = sqlalchemy.orm.Session(engine)
```

Next, we need a mapper_registry to map our classes to the database tables. We will use the default mapper_registry from sqlalchemy.

```python
import coraplex.orm.ormatic_interface
from coraplex.orm.ormatic_interface import *

coraplex.orm.ormatic_interface.Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

Next, we will write a simple plan where the robot parks its arms, moves somewhere, picks up an object, navigates somewhere else, and places it. 

```python
from coraplex.robot_plans import *
from coraplex.motion_executor import simulated_robot
from coraplex.robot_plans.actions.composite.transporting import TransportAction, MoveTorsoAction
from coraplex.datastructures.enums import Arms, Grasp
from coraplex.plans.factories import *
from coraplex.testing import setup_world
from semantic_digital_twin.robots.pr2 import PR2, TorsoState
from coraplex.datastructures.dataclasses import Context


world = setup_world()
pr2_view = PR2.from_world(world)
context = Context(world, pr2_view)

description = TransportAction(world.get_body_by_name("milk.stl"),
                                         Pose.from_xyz_quaternion(3.1, 2.2, 0.95,
                                                                0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, reference_frame=world.root),
                                         Arms.LEFT)
plan = sequential([MoveTorsoAction(TorsoState.HIGH),
        description], context=context).plan
with simulated_robot:
    plan.perform()
```

The data obtained throughout the plan execution, including robot states, poses, action descriptions and more will be
logged into the database once we insert the plan .

```python
from krrood.ormatic.data_access_objects.helper import to_dao, get_dao_class

session.add(to_dao(plan))
session.commit()
```

Now we can query the database to see what we have logged. Let's say we want to see all the NavigateActions that occurred.

```python
from sqlalchemy import select
from coraplex.robot_plans.actions.core.navigation import NavigateAction

navigations = session.scalars(select(get_dao_class(NavigateAction))).all()
print(*navigations, sep="\n")
```

This should print all the pick up actions that occurred during the plan execution, which is one.

Due to the inheritance mapped in the ORM package, we can also get all executed actions with just one query.

```python
from coraplex.robot_plans.actions.base import ActionDescription

actions = session.scalars(select(get_dao_class(ActionDescription))).all()
print(*actions, sep="\n")
```

This should print all the actions that occurred during the plan execution, which is five.
